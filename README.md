# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind the Prework Study Guide was to make it easier for boot camp students to keep track of information they are learning. By creating a website that holds notes taken during prework, students will have all their notes in one place. By creating this project I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
